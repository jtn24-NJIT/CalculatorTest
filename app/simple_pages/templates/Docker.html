    <strong> What is Docker? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Containers: </strong> A standard unit of software, a docker container packages up code and all of its dependencies to ensure
    efficient, reliable and quick running of said application from one computing environment to others. Thanks to docker, a container
    allows for easy execution of a package of software as well as everything needed to run it (IE: system tools, system libraries,
    settings, etc.). These containers in turn allow for quicker and smaller ways to run applications without the typical usage of a
    virtual machine which requires guest operating systems and a hypervisor (in comparison to a container engine and singular operating
    system for docker containers). </p>

    <strong>Images: </strong> Automatically generated when a docker container is made, a docker image is a read-only template which
    contains a set of instructions for making an application run on docker. When ran, it can become one of many instances of a container.
    Made up of multiple layers (which build off from the previous layer with some changes), one of their advantages is that they are
    reusable, which means they can be deployed on any host and across multiple projects (thus saving time). Similar to a git commit, a
    docker image is like a snapshot of a docker container... but they are also immutable, making it so new software or configuration
    does not change the image.</p>
